# PigeonMQF

PigeonMQF is a proof of concept of new features to be implemented to the Pigeon Framework


## Dependencies

### Ruby
Implemented on ruby 2.4.0p0

### RabbitMQ
RabbitMQ is a message broker: it accepts and forwards messages. You can think about it as a post office: when you put the mail that you want posting in a post box, you can be sure that Mr. Postman will eventually deliver the mail to your recipient.In this analogy, RabbitMQ is a post box, a post office and a postman.

A producer is a user application that sends messages. A queue is a buffer that stores messages. A consumer is a user application that receives messages.

### Bunny
Bunny is a RabbitMQ client that focuses on ease of use. It is feature complete, supports all recent RabbitMQ features and does not have any heavyweight dependencies.
